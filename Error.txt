There is a task assigned to me, I need to do cost optimization on Azure.
Plan - I am thinking to fetch the Disk details from Azure which are unattached and not in used for Managed Disks.

I also need to provide the average cost of the unattached Disk for past 30 days.

How can I do it via automation like Python

I also need a beautiful excel report.

Ensure optimized code with Industry Standards and Beautification as well.


Error- Processed disk: PHYSICALDRIVE1-fpkt10msapp1a
WARNING: Alternative cost fetch failed for disk PHYSICALDRIVE3-fpkt10msapp1a: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'ResourceIdOnly'
